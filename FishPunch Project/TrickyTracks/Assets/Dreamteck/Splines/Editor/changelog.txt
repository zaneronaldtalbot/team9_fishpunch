FEATURE: Added an option to disable the automatic update of the SplineRenderer and update it manually with a script


FIX: Improved bezier path closing behavior - broken tangents at the closing point are now properly preserved
FIX: Unsubscribing a SplineUsers from SplineComputers no longer causes other SplineUsers to get unsubscribed.
